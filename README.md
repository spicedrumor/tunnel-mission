How to Play
---
WASD keys to move.

Touch/mouse input works via tapping/clicking on the map.

The basic idea is to move to the "bottom" of the map and get to the pink ! character.

Use the 'h' key (keyboard only) to access a help dialog in-game.

Support
---
For best results, Firefox or Chrome.

IE: Manually resize font size. No audio.

Android and iPhone: No audio, other substantial issues.
